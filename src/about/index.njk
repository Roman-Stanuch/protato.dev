<h2>Greetings, I'm Protato!</h2>
<p> 
    I dabble in all realms of programming, but I have 3 years of experience working with Roblox specifically.
    I specialize in progression and data systems, but I am willing to take on any programming work! I am very
    comfortable in the Luau Programming Language, and I have spent time digging into how the language is designed
    and implemented. Feel free to reach out with programming requests inside or outside of Roblox. While I may not know everything,
    I am willing to learn anything!
</p>

<h2>Key Skills</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Luau programming and debugging</li>
    <li>System planning and implementation</li>
    <li>Quick and effective communication</li>
</ul>
