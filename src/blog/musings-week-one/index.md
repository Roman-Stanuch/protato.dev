<h3>The Idea</h3>
About a week ago I was working at my typical retail job, standing around and doing nothing worthwhile. Usually I’ll go around and clean the store, empty the trash, or make some shelves look pretty, but all of those tasks were either completed or being taken care of. I got to wondering if I could be spending my time doing something more productive and earning more because of it. I got paid the same amount to stand around as I did actually doing work, which either means that standing around is worth as much as the work I was doing, or the work I was doing was worth as much as standing around. Either way I look at it, I know I can be doing better. This is why I have chosen to become a freelance programmer. Freelancing will give me the opportunity to use my specialized knowledge, create something meaningful, and get paid based on my results, not my time on the clock.

<h3>The Plan</h3>
My current plan is to start freelancing as a Roblox scripter. There were two factors that led me to make this decision. The first factor is that I have a lot of experience in Roblox game development. It’s where I started learning text-based programming and I’ve been working with it for years. The second factor is that I am familiar with the Roblox freelancing network. I know the tools, forums, and Discord servers where work is posted and business is conducted. While I hope to eventually move beyond Roblox, I believe it is the best place for me to get started.

<h3>First Steps</h3>
I’ve already started replying to some commission postings for Roblox scripting work. However, my primary job right now is to get a portfolio made. While I’ve done plenty of small projects with Roblox in the past, I don’t really have a lot that shows off my current level of skill. I’m going to have to start working on a new game. It can’t be super big and ambitious because its purpose is really to show off my knowledge and abilities rather than make it to the front page. My current idea is a Work at a Pizza Place like game, but in a movie theater instead. Work at a Movie Theater. I have some philosophical and nostalgia based reasons for choosing this project as well, but I will describe them in a later blog post. Anyways, it’s time to stop writing and get to work!
